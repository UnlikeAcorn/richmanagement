                      ><br />If the Parties are unable to resolve a Dispute
                      through informal negotiations, the Dispute (except those
                      Disputes expressly excluded below) will be finally and
                      exclusively resolved through binding arbitration. YOU

                      RIGHT TO SUE IN COURT AND HAVE A JURY TRIAL. The
                      arbitration shall be commenced and conducted under the

                      and, where appropriate, limited by the AAA Consumer Rules.
                      If such costs are determined by the arbitrator to be
                      excessive, we will pay all arbitration fees and expenses.
                      The arbitration may be conducted in person, through the
                      submission of documents, by phone, or online. The
                      arbitrator will make a decision in writing, but need not
                      provide a statement of reasons unless requested by either
                      Party. The arbitrator must follow applicable law, and any
                      award may be challenged if the arbitrator fails to do so.
                      Except where otherwise required by the applicable AAA
                      rules or applicable law, the arbitration will take place
                      in Brussels, Belgium. Except as otherwise provided herein,
                      the Parties may litigate in court to compel arbitration,
                      stay proceedings pending arbitration, or to confirm,
                      modify, vacate, or enter judgment on the award entered by

                      proceeds in court rather than arbitration, the Dispute
                      shall be commenced or prosecuted in the state and federal

                      neither Party will elect to arbitrate any Dispute falling
